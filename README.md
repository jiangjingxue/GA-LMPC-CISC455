# GA-LMPC-CISC455
Using Genetic Algorithms to tune the penalty matrices and horizon of a Linear Model Predictive Controller

## Instructions
1. Add the folders 'GAHelperFunctons' and 'TrajectoryHelperFunction' to the path 
2. Run the Srcipt 'mpc1GA.m', simulation runs automatically once the evolution is completed. 
3. Main simulation loop for the genetic algorithm starts from line 115 in the main script

## Demo 
A video recording of the simulation is included in the folder 'demo'
